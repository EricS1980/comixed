# ComixEd
An application for managing digital comics.

## Overview And Goals
ComixEd is designed to be a digital comics manager. It will:

 * import your existing and new digital comics
 * organize your comics under a single directory
 * allow you to view and edit the details of the comic	
 * search your comic library by comic details
 * identify, and delete, duplicate pages across comics
 * provide access to your library from a variety of applications

Paired with an application that can read your comics (such as
[Chunky Reader](http://chunkyreader.com/)) you will have a very powerful
and useful solution for reading your comic collection.
